# Magical Highway (Euler Line) of a Triangle
After seeing [this video](https://youtu.be/wVH4MS6v23U) by Numberphile, I got inspired to make this. It draws the centroid, circumcenter and the orthocenter of a triangle, while you get to muck about with the three points of the triangle. It also uses the circumcenter and the orthocenter to draw the [Euler Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_line).
